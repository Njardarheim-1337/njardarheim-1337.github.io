			<h1>How I run this site - part 3 of 7 - Markdown</h1>
			<p><i>7 December 2020</i></p>
			<p>
				When I started thinking about how I would run this website, my main
				thought was that this should be as simple as possible and in a format
				that was permanent and simple, as well as platform and application
				independent. And should be readable.<br />
				<br />
				A Microsoft Word document, for example, is readable and simple, but it
				is bound to Microsoft Word and is not readable by other incompatible
				applications.<br />
				<br />
				An ordinary text file would thus be permanent and simple. And
				absolutely platform and application independent. A text file will for
				all (imaginable) future be readable by a number of applications on all
				thinkable platforms.<br />
				<br />
				The problem with a text file is in the web context that it does not
				contain any formatting.<br />
				<br />
				On the other hand, I might have written my text directly in a document
				in HTML format. But it will then be difficult to read, for example, in
				a text editor. An HTML file contains lots of meta tags that make the
				document less readable.<br />
				<br />
				I wanted a combination of these. A text document where I can write in
				normal language without thinking about tags, which is very readable
				and which is permanent. But that can be easily transferred to HTML for
				web.<br />
				<br />
				The solution is called Markdown.<br />
				<br />
				Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting
				syntax, created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. Markdown is
				often used for formatting readme files, for writing messages in online
				discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text
				editor.<br />
				Learn more about
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown at Wikipedia</a>.<br />
				<br />
				Instead of writing:<br />
			</p>

			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;H1&gt; This is a headline &lt;/H1&gt;</code></pre>
			<br />
			You simply write:<br />
			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">This is a headline<br>==================</code></pre>
			<br />
			This means that the regular text file contains formatted text without
			the use of HTML tags, which makes it very readable and transferable.<br />
			<br />
			Markdown is maintained and explained with good documentation on the
			<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">website of John Gruber: Daring Fireball -
				Markdown.</a><br />
			<br />
			<br />
			In part 4 of this series I will explain how I can easily get this text
			file transformed into an HTML document for web publication.
