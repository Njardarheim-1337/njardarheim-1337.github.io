    <H1>How I run this site - part 2 of 7 - GitHub</H1>
    <P><I>20 November 2020</I></P>
    <P>So how do I manage files and versions?<BR>
<BR>
I work from several different computers from different places.<BR>
It is always a challenge to know how to always work with the latest version of a file. How to keep everything up to date on all computers.<BR>
Additionally, you may want to save different versions of files for recordkeeping.<BR>
<BR>
The simple and obvious choice is to use Git implemented by GitHub.<BR>
Learn more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git at Wikipedia</A>.
GitHub is free for personal projects, and you find it at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a><BR>
<BR>
You then have a centralized repository with all the files in the latest version and earlier versions.<BR>
<BR>
GitHub is easy to use, and you do not need many commands to work with it.<BR>
Github is available for most platforms; Windows, Mac and Linux. I run all these operating systems myself.<BR>
<BR>
After creating a free user profile on GitHub, you can create a project.<BR>
<BR>
To set it up on a new computer, navigate to the desired directory in the terminal and type:<BR>
<blockquote>git clone "url to project"</blockquote>
For example:<BR>
<blockquote>git clone https://github.com/github/training-kit.git</blockquote>
<BR>
This downloads all files with the defined directory structure.<BR>
<BR>
Next time you work on the project, go to the same directory and just type in the terminal:<BR>
<blockquote>git pull</blockquote>
That's it! Now your local repository is 100% in sync.<BR>
<BR>
When you have finished working on the files and want them uploaded to the GitHub repository, you need to commit the files and then upload them.<BR>
Since I work alone with this website, I do not have to think about whether others have checked out files etc.<BR>
<BR>
You can do this in (at least) three different ways.<BR>
<h2>1. Manually in the terminal</h2>
As before, navigate to your local GitHub directory in the terminal and type:<BR>
<blockquote>git add.<BR>
git commit -m "your message here"<BR>
git push</blockquote><BR>
<BR>
<h2>2. Create a bash script</h2>
To avoid writing all three "add", "commit" and "push" each time, create a simple bash script or create an alias (see bulletpoint 3 below).<BR>
<BR>
Open the terminal and type:<BR>
<blockquote>touch gitpush.sh<BR>
vim gitpush.sh</blockquote>
<BR>
In Vim:
Press I for insert mode and type these four lines:<BR>
<blockquote>#!/bin/bash<BR>
git add.<BR>
git commit -m "'$ *'"<BR>
git push</blockquote>
<BR>
Press Esc, then press :wq (to write and quit).<BR>
<BR>
And then make the file executable with:<BR>
<blockquote>chmod +x gitpush.sh</blockquote>
<BR>
Put the file in a directory located in your path. For example the /bin directory.<BR>
<BR>
Then just type:<BR>
<blockquote>./gitpush.sh My comment for this version</blockquote>
<BR>
<h2>3. Make an alias</h2>
This is the way I roll.<BR>
Most people have their aliases in either ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_aliases<BR>
<BR>
Open the file as follows:<BR>
<blockquote>vim ~/.bash_aliases</blockquote>
<BR>
In Vim:<BR>
Press I for Insert mode and type these lines:<BR>
<blockquote>gitpush_function () {<BR>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	git add.<BR>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	git commit -m "$ *"<BR>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	git push<BR>
}<BR>
alias gitpush = gitpush_function</blockquote>
<BR>
Press Esc, then press :wq (to write and quit).<BR>
<BR>
To get the new alias valid, type in the terminal:<BR>
<blockquote>source ~/.bashrc</blockquote>
<BR>
So in the future you now just write:<BR>
<blockquote>gitpush My comment for this version</blockquote>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>That was it!</B><BR>
<BR>
PS! You can find simple explanations of all the Git commands here: <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/">Git Guides</a><BR>
<BR>
The next time I have to work with the web pages - no matter which computer - I run the same routine. Starts the computer, opens the terminal and navigates to my git directory, and then "git pull".<BR>
<BR>
Do the work I'm going to do.<BR>
<BR>
And then I finish my work by just typing "gitpush This is my comment".<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This was part 2 of 7. Have you read <a href="./philosophy.html">part 1</a>? Part 3 is coming soon and will cover how I write my text.
