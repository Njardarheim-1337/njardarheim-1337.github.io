			<h1>How I run this site - part 2 of 7 - GitHub</h1>
			<p><i>20 November 2020</i></p>
			<p>
				So how do I manage files and versions?<br />
				<br />
				I work from several different computers from different places.<br />
				It is always a challenge to know how to always work with the latest
				version of a file. How to keep everything up to date on all
				computers.<br />
				Additionally, you may want to save different versions of files for
				recordkeeping.<br />
				<br />
				The simple and obvious choice is to use Git implemented by GitHub.<br />
				Learn more about
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git at Wikipedia</a>.
				GitHub is free for personal projects, and you find it at
				<a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a><br />
				<br />
				You then have a centralized repository with all the files in the
				latest version and earlier versions.<br />
				<br />
				GitHub is easy to use, and you do not need many commands to work with
				it.<br />
				Github is available for most platforms; Windows, Mac and Linux. I run
				all these operating systems myself.<br />
				<br />
				After creating a free user profile on GitHub, you can create a
				project.<br />
				<br />
				To set it up on a new computer, navigate to the desired directory in
				the terminal and type:<br />
			</p>

			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git clone "url to project"</code></pre>
			For example:<br />
			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/github/training-kit.git			</code></pre>
			<br />
			This downloads all files with the defined directory structure.<br />
			<br />
			Next time you work on the project, go to the same directory and just
			type in the terminal:<br />
			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git pull</code></pre>
			That's it! Now your local repository is 100% in sync.<br />
			<br />
			When you have finished working on the files and want them uploaded to
			the GitHub repository, you need to commit the files and then upload
			them.<br />
			Since I work alone with this website, I do not have to think about
			whether others have checked out files etc.<br />
			<br />
			You can do this in (at least) three different ways.<br />
			<h2>1. Manually in the terminal</h2>
			As before, navigate to your local GitHub directory in the terminal and
			type:<br />
			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git add.<br />git commit -m "your message here"<br />git push</code></pre>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>2. Create a bash script</h2>
			To avoid writing all three "add", "commit" and "push" each time, create
			a simple bash script or create an alias (see bulletpoint 3 below).<br />
			<br />
			Open the terminal and type:<br />
			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">touch gitpush.sh<br />vim gitpush.sh</code></pre>
			<br />
			In Vim: Press I for insert mode and type these four lines:<br />
			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">#!/bin/bash<br />git add.<br />git commit -m "'$ *'"<br />git push</code></pre>
			<br />
			Press Esc, then press :wq (to write and quit).<br />
			<br />
			And then make the file executable with:<br />
			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">chmod +x gitpush.sh</code></pre>
			<br />
			Put the file in a directory located in your path. For example the /bin
			directory.<br />
			<br />
			Then just type:<br />
			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">./gitpush.sh My comment for this version</code></pre>
			<br />
			<h2>3. Make an alias</h2>
			This is the way I roll.<br />
			Most people have their aliases in either ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_aliases<br />
			<br />
			Open the file as follows:<br />
			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">vim ~/.bash_aliases</code></pre>
			<br />
			In Vim:<br />
			Press I for Insert mode and type these lines:<br />
			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gitpush_function () {<br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; git add.<br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; git commit -m "$ *"<br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; git push<br />}<br />alias gitpush = gitpush_function</code></pre>
			<br />
			Press Esc, then press :wq (to write and quit).<br />
			<br />
			To get the new alias valid, type in the terminal:<br />
			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">source ~/.bashrc</code></pre>
			<br />
			So in the future you now just write:<br />
			<pre data-lang="bash"
				class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gitpush My comment for this version</code></pre>
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<b>That was it!</b><br />
			<br />
			PS! You can find simple explanations of all the Git commands here:
			<a href="https://github.com/git-guides/">Git Guides</a><br />
			<br />
			The next time I have to work with the web pages - no matter which
			computer - I run the same routine. Starts the computer, opens the
			terminal and navigates to my git directory, and then "git pull".<br />
			<br />
			Do the work I'm going to do.<br />
			<br />
			And then I finish my work by just typing "gitpush This is my
			comment".<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			This was part 2 of 7. Have you read
			<a href="./philosophy.html">part 1</a>? Part 3 is coming soon and will
			cover how I write my text.
