        I really want to get to know more distros, and I've been thinking a bit about how to go about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found a retired Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano Gen 1 that I've had lying unused.<br>
	The idea I've had is that I'll now use this as my main computer, and switch distros every 3 months.

        Finding empty columns in SQL Server tables
      </h1>
      <p><em>11 April 2023</em></p>
      <p>
        Sometimes you have database tables with columns that have no values.
      </p>
      <p>
        And you might want to hide these columns for users, but to check every
        row of every column in every table is time consuming. This script
        should help you.

        How to keep using old and cheap hardware. Or how I bricked my QNAP and

        Have had some time off from this site. Part 5-7 of my short series
        have to wait a bit longer
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, I'm going to tell you about when I was trying to put
        Debian on an old QNAP NAS I had lying around.

      <h1>How I run this site - part 4 of 7 - Aspell</h1>
      <p><i>24 May 2021</i></p>
      <p>The next step is spellchecking.</p>
      <p>
        For this I use Aspell. Aspell is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) spell
        checker. If you run a Linux distro Aspell is most surely installed.

      <p>
        I work from several different computers from different places.
        <br />
        It is always a challenge to know how to always work with the latest
        version of a file. How to keep everything up to date on all
        computers.<br />
        Additionally, you may want to save different versions of files for
        recordkeeping.<br />

      <p>
        My philosophy when it comes to this website is that here the content
        should be in focus, and not distracting graphics and cool effects.<br />
        <br />
        I have observed in the last couple of years that more and more
        "text-only" websites are popping up.<br />

      <h1>So why GOTO 10?</h1>
      <p><i>2 November 2020</i></p>
      <p>
        My first experience with computers goes back to 1983. For my birthday
        my parents gave me a Commodore 64.<br />
        I was hooked from the first day.<br />
        After playing games for a while I started looking into what else I
        could do with this magic box.<br />
