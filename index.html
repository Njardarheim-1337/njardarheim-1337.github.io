<p><em>11 April 2023</em></p>
<p>Sometimes you have database tables with columns that have no values.</p>
<p>And you might want to hide these columns for users, but to check every row of every column in every table is time consuming. This script should help you.</p>

    <H1>How I run this site - part 4 of 7 - Aspell</H1>
    <P><I>24 May 2021</I></P>
    <p>The next step is spellchecking.</p>
<p>For this I use Aspell. Aspell is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) spell checker. If you run a Linux distro Aspell is most surely installed.</p>

   <H1>How I run this site - part 2 of 7 - GitHub</H1>
    <P><I>20 November 2020</I></P>
    <P>I work from several different computers from different places.
    <BR>
It is always a challenge to know how to always work with the latest version of a file. How to keep everything up to date on all computers.<BR>
Additionally, you may want to save different versions of files for recordkeeping.<BR>

    <H1>How I run this site - part 1 of 7 - philosophy</H1>
    <P><I>11 November 2020</I></P>
    <P>My philosophy when it comes to this website is that here the content should be in focus,
      and not distracting graphics and cool effects.<BR>
        <BR>
      I have observed in the last couple of years that more and more "text-only" websites are popping up.<BR>

    <H1>So why GOTO 10?</H1>
    <P><I>2 November 2020</I></P>
    <P>My first experience with computers goes back to 1983. For my birthday my parents gave me a Commodore 64.<BR>
    I was hooked from the first day.<BR>
    After playing games for a while I started looking into what else I could do with this magic box.<BR>
